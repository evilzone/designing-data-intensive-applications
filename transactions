Transactions
------------

A: atomicity => all or nothing => abortability
C: consistency => foreign key constraints
I: isolation => serializability
D: durability => storage + recovery guarantees

Single object writes vs  multi object writes
Application developer's huge role: concurrency

Weak isolation levels

1. No dirty reads (read committed)
2. No dirty writes
3. Snapshot isolation - repeated reads
4. No lost updates - overwrite
5. no write skews - premise false
6. no phantom reads
7. serializability
    a. actual serialization
        - cpu core | thread for writes, partition
    b. two phase locking - lock vs wait
    c. serializable snapshot isolation - abort if not serial
