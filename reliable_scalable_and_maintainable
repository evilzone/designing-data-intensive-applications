Reliable, scalable and maintainable
-----------------------------------

Is yours a data-intensive use case?
    - an application is data intensive if the amount of data that it generates/uses increases quickly or if
    the complexity of data that it generates/uses increases quickly or if the speed of change in data increases
    quickly.

Main components in a data-intensive app:
    1. Databases for source of truth for any consumer. E.g. Oracle/MySQL
    2. Cache for temporarily storing an expensive operation to speed up reads. E.g. Memcache
    3. Full-text Index for quickly searching data by keyword or filter e.g Apache Lucene
    4. Message queues for message passing between process. e.g. Apache kafka
    5. Stream processing E.g. Apache Samza, Apache Spark
    6. Batch processing for crunching large amount of data. e.g. Apache spark/Hadoop
    7. Application code  which acts as the connective tissue between the above components

- Role of the application developer is to design the data system for reliability, scalability
    and maintainability

Reliability
    - Fault tolerance
    - No unauthorized access
    - Chaos testing
    - Full machine failures
    - Bugs - automated tests
    - Staging/testing environment
    - Quickly roll-back

Scalability
    - Handle higher traffic volume
    - Traffic load with peak #of reads, writes and simultaneous users
    - Capacity planning
    - Response time vs throughput
    - End user response time
    - 90th, 95th percentile SL0/A service level objectives/agreements
    - scaling up (more powerful machine)
    - scaling out (distributed many smaller machines)

Maintainability
    - Add new people to work
    - Productivity
    - Operable: configurable and testable
    - Simple: easy to understand and ramp up
    - Evolveable: easy to change

There  is no one magic solution that works well for all data-intensive application use cases. Your solution will
be custom to your needs, as long as you have a good idea of above three pillars of reliability, scalability and
maintainability you will build the right system.
